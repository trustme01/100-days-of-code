# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Daily Practice from DataCamp and Finally moved from the Passing a List section of Python Crash Course to the Try It Yourself challenges. 

**Thoughts:** Still get a bit off topic but working on completing one task at a time instead of doing multiple things/ topics at the same time.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished DataCamp daily practice. 
<!--Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.--> 

**Thoughts**: 
<!-- I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

<!-- **Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

<!-- **Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

### Day 5: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my daily DataCamp practice. 

**Thoughts:**: If I had commited to this challange as a New Year's Resolution I probably would've given up since I had missed 2 days due to the fact I was working at a friends business. While I was working though, I had this nagging feeling of completing my daily practice, which feels like not a goal, but a must do a feeling comparable to having to pay bills. 

### Day 7: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my daily DataCamp practice and on a 3 day streak! 

**Thoughts:**: Ditto as above! 

### Day 8: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed my daily DataCamp practice and on a 4 day streak. Also, FINALLY finished the Python DataScience ToolBox part 2 course and got a certificate!
