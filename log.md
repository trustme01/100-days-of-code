# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Daily Practice from DataCamp and Finally moved from the Passing a List section of Python Crash Course to the Try It Yourself challenges. 

**Thoughts:** Still get a bit off topic but working on completing one task at a time instead of doing multiple things/ topics at the same time.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

<!-- **Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

<!-- **Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

<!-- **Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
